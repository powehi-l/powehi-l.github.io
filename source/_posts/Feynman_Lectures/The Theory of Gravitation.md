# 两个基本原则

Law of gravitation: Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which for any two bodies is proportional to the mass of each and varies inversely as the square of the distance between them.

First law of Newton: An object responds to a force by accelerating in the direction of the force by an amount that is inversely proportional to the mass of the object,

# Kepler's three laws

1. Each planet moves around the sun in an ellipse, with the sum at one focus.
2. The radius vector from the sun to the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time.
3. The squares of the periods of any two planets are proportional to the cubes of the semimajor axes of their respective orbits: $T \propto a^{\frac{3}{2}}$
